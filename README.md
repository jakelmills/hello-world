# hello-world
Hi everyone,

I'm Jake Mills and this is my first repository. 
I currently have basic knowledge of HTML and CSS but I am furthering my journey into web development and pushing my skills to their limits.
I am doing multiple courses about full stack web development and hope to learn more about the neccesary skills required, including Git/Github, Javascript, Ruby and many more.
I am commited to improving my skills and keeping up to date with the latest technologies.

I believe it is time that I apply myself and push myself to reach my goals.

Thanks for reading. :)
